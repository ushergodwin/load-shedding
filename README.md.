Show power outages by search 
we all get annoyed when power just gets off, especially in the middle of writing your most important scripts, or chatting with your friends
if you knew when and at what the power would be off in your area, then you would prepare for the outage in advance.
this project intends to let users know when the power outages will take place, in just a single word search.
